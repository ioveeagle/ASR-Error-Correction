DNN CODES
===================
To compile codes that process DNN, use command below:
    $ g++ -O2 readmacrodnn.cpp utility.cpp -o readdnn


2) Check DNN computation results
   To generate test feature in Kaldi format, you have to do two things:
       (1) turn on #define TEST_FEATURE 1
       (2) set the last input argument of DNN:generateTestFeature() to 1, 
           which will write randomly generated features to file 'testfeat.ark'.

   Execute following command to call Kaldi to calculate posterior probability 
   of each frame in 'testfeat.ark' and redirect the result to a file 'abc.txt':

       nnet-am-compute dnn.mdl ark,t:testfeat.ark ark,t:- > abc.txt

   Execute following command to calculate posterior probability of each frame
   with our program and redirect the result to a file 'def.txt':
	
       ./readdnn > def.txt

   Use any text editor to compare the above two files. Due to difference of 
   implementation details, the answers should be very close but not exactly 
   the same.
